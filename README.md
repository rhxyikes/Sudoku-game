# Sudoku-game
I have built a Sudoku Game in C++ programming language. The project helped me learn Backtracking Algorithms.
FEATURES:
1. Interactive Sudoku gameplay.
2. The ability to generate a random one.
3. Check the validity of your solution.
4. A user-friendly interface.

Before you can run the Sudoku game, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
1. C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile the source code.
